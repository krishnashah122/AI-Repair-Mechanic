# Car and Aircraft Repair Mechanic Chatbot (Text-Based)

This project is a **text-based chatbot** powered by **Google's Gemini API** that acts as a virtual **car/aircraft repair mechanic**. The chatbot provides professional advice and analysis for car/aircraft damage repair based on user inputs.

## Features:
- Accepts three user inputs: **damage type**, **damage strength (in percentage)**, and **damaged part of the car/aircraft**.
- Uses these inputs to generate a detailed response that includes:
  - Type of repair needed
  - Severity of the damage
  - Potential risks and precautions
- Utilizes **Streamlit** to create an interactive web interface.
- Provides a simple and intuitive interface for users to get expert-like responses on car/aircraft damage analysis and repair.

## Technologies Used:
- **Python**
- **Streamlit** for the web interface
- **Google Generative AI (Gemini API)** for generating car/aircraft repair responses

## How It Works:
1. The user inputs the type of car/aircraft damage, its severity, and the affected part.
2. The chatbot processes the information and generates a text-based analysis, providing recommendations and repairs specific to the input provided.
3. No image inputs are needed, making it simple and lightweight.
